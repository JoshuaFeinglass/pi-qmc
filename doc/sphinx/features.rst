Features
--------

A primary motivation of pi-qmc is to have a framework so that features
developed by one student or for one research project can be used
in many different contexts.
Some of the many features developed for pi-qmc include:

* Bosons
* Exact fermions
* Fixed-node fermions
* Coulomb Interactions
* Linear Response Theory
* Electron-Hole recombination rates.
* Exact magnetic fields and fixed-phase.
* Multilevel sampling.
* Collective sampling.
* Free-energy sampling.
* Spin flips.

We are developing system integration tests to document and verify the status
of these features.
